# Real-Time Pok√©mon Search App

A real-time Pok√©mon search application built with React and the Pok√©mon API (PokeAPI). This app allows users to search for Pok√©mon, view their details like height, weight, types, and images. It also includes a caching mechanism using `localStorage` for better performance on repeat searches.

## Features

- **Search**: Type in the search bar to find Pok√©mon by name.
- **Debounced Search**: The search is debounced to reduce API calls while typing.
- **Caching**: Pok√©mon data is fetched and stored in `localStorage` to avoid redundant API calls on subsequent visits.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the components.
- **PokeAPI**: API to fetch Pok√©mon data.
